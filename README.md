# MITIE-train-and-testing
This repository includes some files that test the MITIE library

This repo is MIT licensed, and currently is a derived work from the MIT licensed Mitie project (https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE)

# Usage
Currently, the way to use this repository is as such:

1) Modify the files in the original MITIE library (https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE), if the file's name is the same over that repo or on here
2) Copy the files in the `how-to-run` folder, into the same folder the file you have modified is in
3) Run the `sh` file
4) Fix and modify the `sh` file if there are any errors.

# Note
As there is not a lot of documentation, one is encouraged to read the code available here to make use of this repository. There is not much code here anyway, so it won't be a big task.
